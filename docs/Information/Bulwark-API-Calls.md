# Bulwark API call list (as of version 2.0.0)

## Common operations
-----------------

### Listing my Bulwark addresses

Listing the Bulwark addresses in your wallet is easily done via
*listreceivedbyaddress*. It normally lists only addresses which already
have received transactions, however you can list all the addresses by
setting the first argument to 0, and the second one to true.

[Accounts](Accounts-Explained.md) are used to organize addresses.
