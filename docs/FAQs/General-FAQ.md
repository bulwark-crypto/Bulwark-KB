##### Q: Where can I download the Bulwark wallet?

##### Q: Is Bulwark just a fork of PIVX?

A: Bulwark is forked off of an older, more stable version of PIVX. We then hand patched it up to PIVX 2.3, and then backported code from Bitcoin 0.13 and DASH 12.1. More information is available in the [Whitepaper and Lightpaper](https://bulwarkcrypto.com/whitepaper).

##### Q: What will this coin have that other PIVX/DASH clones don't have?

A: The Bulwark Secure Home Node, Citadel Home Router, Aegis Hardware Wallet and Zerocoin. There are quite a few things that the majority of forks don't have that we will and that's only what we've announced to date. We'd like to focus on integrating some of these updates before announcing any additional plans.

##### Q: What is SwiftTX?

A: Masternodes are able to instantaneously validate and confirm transactions before they are added onto the blockchain. This allows for extremely fast transactions that do not require additional confirmations.

A: This is a fund that will be set aside. After the end of year 1 or block 345,600. Masternode operators will be able to vote on budget proposals and dictate fund allocation. This system is hard-coded and puts the future of Bulwark into the hands of the community and encourages engagement.

##### Q: Does Bulwark plan to be listed on **X Exchange** any time soon?

A: The Bulwark team is committed to the long-term health and stability of this project. Major exchanges want to see novel features and longevity from non-ICO coins prior to listing.
