# Masternode FAQ

##### Q: How many coins for a Masternode, and how do I set one up?

A: You will need a total of 5000 BWK. Follow this [Guide](https://github.com/bulwark-crypto/Bulwark-MN-Install) to set one up.

##### Q: What is a shared Masternode, and how do I get in one?

A: Users can pool their funds to gather up the 5000 BWK required to operate a masternode. Shared masternodes are trust based and require that you trust the node operator not to take your funds. The Bulwark Team does not support or endorse any masternode operator and advises caution to anyone considering participating in a shared masternode group.

##### Q: How much does a Bulwark Masternode make?

A: Masternode profits vary on the price of the coin, what percent of rewards the nodes get, and how many are online. You can check out these websites for that information:

* [the Official Bulwark Block Explorer](https://explorer.bulwarkcrypto.com/)

* [Masternodes Pro](https://masternodes.pro/stats/bwk)

* [Masternodes Online](https://masternodes.online/currencies/BWK/)

* [MnRank](http://mnrank.com/)

##### Q: Is my Masternode running?

A: A good way to check to see if your masternode is running is to make sure it says “Enabled” in the wallet, and that the Active timer is increasing.
Run `bulwark-cli masternode status`on your VPS. It should say "Masternode successfully started". If everything works as it should, it's running!

##### Q: How long does it take to get your first Masternode reward?

A: The first Masternode reward can take up to 24 plus the average Masternode reward time. The average reward time can be found on [the Official Bulwark Block Explorer](https://explorer.bulwarkcrypto.com/) or on Masternode statistic sites such as [Masternodes Online](https://masternodes.online/currencies/BWK/) for example.
