# Wallet Syncing and Launching Issues

1. Make sure you are running the latest wallet version from [the Official Bulwark Github](https://github.com/bulwark-crypto/Bulwark/releases) and your wallet is closed.
2. Now you head over to the Bulwark folder (How to do that is guided below)
3. Delete all files except wallet.dat, bulwark.conf, masternode.conf and the backups folder.

#### How to find your Bulwark folder:

**Windows:** Press `Windows+R` and write `%appdata%`

**macOS:** Press `Command+Space` to open Spotlight, write `~/Library/Application Support/Bulwark` and press Enter.

**Linux:** Open `~/.bulwark/`
