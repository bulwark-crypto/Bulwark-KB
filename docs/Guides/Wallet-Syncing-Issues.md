# Wallet Syncing Issues

* Make sure you are running the latest wallet version from [the Official Bulwark Github](https://github.com/bulwark-crypto/Bulwark/releases) and your wallet is closed.
* Now you head over to the Bulwark folder (How to do that is explained below).
* Delete all files except wallet.dat, masternode.conf,the backups folder, and the Zerocoin folder..
* Open your wallet

#### How to find your Bulwark folder:

**Windows:** Press `Windows+R` and write `%appdata%`

**macOS:** Press `Command+Space` to open Spotlight, write `~/Library/Application Support/Bulwark` and press Enter.

**Linux:** Open `~/.bulwark/`
