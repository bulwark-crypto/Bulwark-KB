# Is my Masternode working? Guide

## To check if your Masternode is active and working:

1. In your local wallet: Verify that you see the status "ENABLED" in your Masternode tab, and that the Active timer is increasing.
2. On your VPS: Run `bulwark-cli masternode status`, it should say "Masternode successfully started".
