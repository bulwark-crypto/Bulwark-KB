Multisend is a very easy to use tool, that makes managing staking and masternode rewards easy.

The 1st step to setting up MultiSend is to head to the Multisend tool, this is available under Settings>MultiSend as shown below.

Then, you need to choose the address of either your masternode or staking address that is receiving the rewards. This will either be your masternode "Pubkey" listed on your masternode tab,
or it could be any address you stake with when referring to staking. To select the address from the list, click it once and then click "CHOOSE".

Now the address you chose should be visible, as in the screenshot below, before the next step tick "Send For Staking" and/or "Send for Masternodes" depending on what kind of rewards you want to be sending. Click "ACTIVATE".

You should now see the "MultiSend Status" change to "Enabled for Staking and Masternodes" as in the screenshot above. Next we want to configure where the awards sent to the address on-screen will be forwarded to,
for this, we need to click "CONFIGURE" to bring up the screen shown below.

Finally, you want to choose the send addresses. Click the "+" button in the top right corner to add as many addresses as you need. Then, you can either paste the address in to the large box shown above, or you can use the address
book again (1st button to the right of the text boxes) to add addresses. These addresses are where the rewards sent to the previously selected address are sent. You can then select a percentage amount, that percentage of received
rewards will be forwarded to the chosen address. If the percentages chosen are less than 100%, remaining rewards will stay in the original address.

Once you have decided where the rewards will go, and how much of them will go, click the save button below the "+" and then click "ACTIVATE". You can then close the MultiSend window and it will manage rewards automatically.
