# Masternode Installation

## System requirements

The VPS you plan to install your masternode on needs to have at least 1GB of RAM and 10GB of free disk space. We do not recommend using servers who do not meet those criteria, and your masternode will not be stable. We also recommend you do not use cloud hosting for your masternode.

## Funding your masternode

* First, we will do the initial collateral TX and send exactly 5000 BWK to one of our addresses. To keep things sorted in case we setup more masternodes we will label the addresses we use.

  - Open your BWK wallet and switch to the "Receive" tab.

  - Click into the label field and create a label, I will use MN1

  - Now click on "Request payment"

  - The generated address will now be labelled as MN1 If you want to setup more masternodes just repeat the steps so you end up with several addresses for the total number of nodes you wish to setup. Example: For 10 nodes you will need 10 addresses, label them all.

  - Once all addresses are created send 5000 BWK each to them. Ensure that you send exactly 5000 BWK and do it in a single transaction. You can double check where the coins are coming from by checking it via coin control usually, that's not an issue.

As soon as all 5k transactions are done, we will wait for 15 confirmations. You can check this in your wallet or use the explorer.
It should take around 30 minutes if all transaction have 15 confirmations.

## Getting everything ready

Generate your Masternode Private Key

In your wallet, open Tools -> Debug console and run the following command to get your masternode key:

```bash
masternode genkey
```

Please note: If you plan to set up more than one masternode, you need to create a key with the above command for each one.

Run this command to get your output information:

```bash
masternode outputs
```

Copy both the key and output information to a text file.

Close your wallet and open the Bulwark Appdata folder. Its location depends on your OS.

* **Windows:** %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Bulwark
_Press Windows+R and write %appdata%_

* **Linux:** ~/.bulwark/
_Navigate to the .bulwark folder in your home directory_

* **macOS:** ~/Library/Application Support/Bulwark
_Press Cmd+Space, type ~/Library/Application Support/Bulwark and press Enter._

In your appdata folder, open masternode.conf with a text editor and add a new line in this format to the bottom of the file:

```bash
masternodename ipaddress:52543 genkey collateralTxID outputID
```

An example would be

```
mn1 127.0.0.2:52543 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1sBGLALQZE1Y1K6xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f7ea86e4e56834c2927a07f9e1871810b92e0d0324456a67c 0
```

_masternodename_ is a name you choose, _ipaddress_ is the public IP of your VPS, masternodeprivatekey is the output from `masternode genkey`, and _collateralTxID_ & _outputID_ come from `masternode outputs`.

Please note that _masternodename_ must not contain any spaces, and should not contain any special characters.

Restart and unlock your wallet.

## Installation

SSH (Putty on Windows, Terminal.app on macOS) to your VPS, login as root (**Please note:** It's normal that you don't see your password after typing or pasting it) and run the following command:

```bash
bash <( curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bulwark-crypto/Bulwark-MN-Install/master/install.sh )
```

When the script asks, confirm your VPS IP Address and paste your masternode key.
(You can copy your key and paste into the VPS if connected with Putty by right clicking)

The installer will then present you with a few options.

**PLEASE NOTE**: Do not choose the advanced installation option unless you have experience with Linux and know what you are doing. Advanced mode  will install your masternode under a non-root user called "bulwark" instead of root, so you need to know what that means and how to log in as a different user under Linux. If you don't, things will not work as expected and the Bulwark team CANNOT help you - you will have to restart the installation.

Follow the instructions on screen.

After the basic installation is done, the wallet will sync. You will see the following message:

```
Your masternode is syncing. Please wait for this process to finish.
This can take up to a few hours. Do not close this window.
```

Once you see "Masternode setup completed." on screen, you are done.
