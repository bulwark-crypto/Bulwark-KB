# Staking Guide

1. Make sure you have the latest wallet version downloaded from our [Github](https://github.com/bulwark-crypto/Bulwark/releases) and the wallet is fully synced with atleast 100 BWK in each input. Also make sure that each input has atleast 475 confirmations.
2. Now you unlock your wallet for staking only (By ticking the box right next to the password field and typing in your password.).
3. If everything worked, the Staking-Icon on the bottom right should turn dark blue and say "Staking status: true".

Please keep in mind, that it can take up to a few minutes for the Staking-Icon to turn dark blue and display "Staking Status:true".
Also every other status except "multisend" needs to be true as well in order to stake.

If it still doesn't work after following these steps, please join our [Discord](https://discord.me/bulwarkcrypto) for further help.
